# Quantum_Artificial_Neuron
: Implemented the quantum information-based algorithm proposed by Tacchino et al., which is a quantum model of a binary-valued perceptron and can be used as a non-linear classifier for simple patterns. The algorithm was implemented and simulated for 3-qubit pattern classification using Qiskit developement kit and Qasm simulator with noise models.
