Implemented the quantum information-based algorithm proposed by Tacchino et al. [paper link](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41534-019-0140-4), which is a quantum model of a binary-valued perceptron and can be used as a non-linear classifier for simple patterns. The algorithm was implemented and simulated for 3-qubit pattern classification using Qiskit developement kit and Qasm simulator with noise models.

- The jupyter notebook contains the explanation, algorithm implementation and results.
